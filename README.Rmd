# clinicalfd (Clinical Fake Data)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of clinicalfd is to create Fake SDTM/ADaM data for generating TFL.This data is 
available at  (https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts) for free to download for public use see the licence here (https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

## Installation

You can install the released version of clinicalfd (clinical fake data) from [Github](https://github.com/sas2r/clinical_fd)

General Instructions:

Make sure you have lateset version of R-language , the way to check is 
session() . If it 0.4.7 then the Package may not be loaded. To take care of that is 

If you are R studio on Personnel drive then
first Install.packages ("rlang") , then library (rlang) , check sessionInfo ()
NOTE: If you are using Rstudio on cloud this may would not work , simply go to right most corner of the window and change the R version to 4.0 or 4.1. 

The way to install this package is In the R-studio in Console 

install.packages("devtools")  wait for the dev tools to be installed 
 then call the library(devtools). Once the devtools is installed then you can call install_github("sas2r/clinical_fd")  to 
install the package clinical_fd  (all lower case , with the underscore in it  ) then call library(clincalfd) (without the underscore)

During the process of Installation ( May take around 10 min depending on the System) you will see couple of packages either been downloaded or updated. 

NOTE: Make sure you type in exactly as shown below without # for install packages part

```{r example}
#install.packages("devtools") 

library(devtools)

#install_github("sas2r/clinical_fd")

library(clinicalfd)
## basic example code
```


Once you have the clinicalfd installed you can start calling the SDTM datasets
List of SDTM Data sets available in ‘clinicalfd’ package are:

ae               
cm               
dm               
ds              
ex              
lbch

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r cars}
summary(dm)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gender, echo = FALSE}
race <- dplyr::select(dm , race, age)
plot(race )
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
