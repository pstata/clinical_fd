# clinicalfd

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of clinicalfd is to create Fake SDTM/ADaM data for generating TFL.

## Installation

You can install the released version of clinicalfd (clinical fake data) from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

 
The way to install this package is 
when you open the R-studio in Console 

install.packages("devtools")  wait for the dev tools to be installed 
 then call the library(devtools). Once the devtools is installed then you can call install_github("sas2r/clinical_fd")  to 
install the package clinical_fd  (all lower case , with the underscore in it  ) then call library(clincalfd) (without the underscore)

```{r example}
#install.packages("devtools") 

library(devtools)

#install_github("sas2r/clinical_fd")

library(clinicalfd)
## basic example code
```
Once you have the clinicalfd installed you can start calling the SDTM datasets
List of SDTM Data sets available in ‘clinicalfd’ package are:

cm               
dm               
ds

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r cars}
summary(dm)
```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gender, echo = FALSE}
race <- dplyr::select(dm , race, age)
plot(race )
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
